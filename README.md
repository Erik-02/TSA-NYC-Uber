# TSA-NYC-Uber

The task of this project is to support the logistic team in the company with a prediction 
approach for the average demand of taxis per hour over the day in the ten most important 
clusters of the available data. So, I have some data about Uber pickup rides from April to 
September 2014 from New York City. The data has only a time of pickup, and a location. 
Thus, I must extract as much information as possible from the data and cluster the data 
together based on their attributes using some machine learning model. There-after, I should 
make predictions on the number of pickups to be expected per hour for each one of these 
cluster locations.
